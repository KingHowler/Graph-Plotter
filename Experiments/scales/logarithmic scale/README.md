# Y / e^X Grid experiment

## Experiment 1

![Y / e^X](Screenshots/Screenshot.png)
An experiment to produce the grid of y over e^x

## Experiment 2

![y = e^x on Y / e^X](Screenshots/Screenshot2.png)
An experiment to produce a straight line of y = e^x on a grid with axis of y over e^x

![normal](Screenshots/Screenshot3.png)
A graph of y = e^x on a normal, linear scale for refrence

## Experiment successful <br> Found a way to implement custom scales on GP object
