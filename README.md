# Graph Plotter
This is a Graph Plotter. <br>
This tool is designed to make graphs based on raw data. It can take the data from Mathematical Equations, Manually, Programmed Calculation, as well as from a Serial Communication Device such as an Arduino using the function ```Serial.println(Numeric_Value)```. <br>
It can take data however you please and create as many graphs as you want with whatever format you wish to. As long as you can provide the data anything is possible.<br>
The tool will then manipulate the data based on user-defined variables to sketch a graph of y against x.<br>
It's a great way to visualize data and analyze trends especially for experimentation where graphs can't be made using math equations which is the only format the traditional graph plotters accept.
### Software : [Processing](https://processing.org/download)
Processing is a free and easy to use software for Visual Arts and Displays. It is an open project initiated by Ben Fry and Casey Reas. With just a little amount of programming knowledge and using the [Reference Guide](https://processing.org/reference/), you can make almost anything.
